# Motion Swatch

Capture motion from a real video, extract it into a reusable **motion swatch**, and
apply it to any object in a piece of vector artwork. A flag clip becomes a "Flag
Flutter" swatch you can drop onto a banner; a smoke clip becomes rising steam over
a coffee cup. Motion is stored as **8 editable numbers + a 12×12 grid of real point
trajectories**, not baked video — so it re-times, re-scales, and re-applies to any
shape.

## What it does

1. **Load artwork** — a built-in Poster or Scenery scene, or upload your own
   SVG / PNG / JPEG.
2. **Select an object** — click any SVG object (or draw a rectangle on a raster
   image). Each object becomes an independently animatable region.
3. **Get a motion** — pick one of 8 built-in presets, or click **"Capture motion
   from video"** and upload a short clip. The clip is analyzed with **RAFT optical
   flow** and distilled into a swatch.
4. **Apply & tune** — assign the swatch to the selected object, adjust Speed /
   Intensity, toggle **Cloth mode** (the geometry itself ripples, in place, instead
   of moving rigidly).
5. **Play** — every object animates at once with its own motion.
6. **Export** — animated SVG or a video of the result.

## Quick start

The browser app is **vanilla JS + SVG + Canvas** — no build step, no npm install.
The Python analysis service is **optional** (the app falls back to a lighter
in-browser analyzer if it isn't running), but recommended for best extraction.

### 1. Serve the web app

```bash
cd motion-swatch-poc
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. (Optional) Start the RAFT analysis service

```bash
cd service
./run.sh        # first run creates a venv and downloads the ~4 MB raft_small checkpoint
```

This serves the analyzer at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`. The app auto-detects it; if it
is down, capture still works using the in-browser analyzer.

**Requirements** (installed automatically by `run.sh`): Python 3.9+, `torch`,
`torchvision`, `numpy`, `opencv-python-headless`, `fastapi`, `uvicorn`. Runs on
Apple-silicon MPS, CUDA, or CPU.

### 3. (Optional) Start the character-motion (pose) service

This powers the **Character** tab and the `duck-walk.html` demo. It extracts a real
walk/dance from a video with **MediaPipe Pose** (no hardcoding) and retargets it onto
a rigged character.

```bash
./service/run-pose.sh   # first run creates ./mpvenv and installs MediaPipe, then serves :8770
```

⚠️ **MediaPipe has no wheel for Python 3.13** — it needs Python **3.9–3.12**. The
script auto-picks a compatible interpreter and builds a *separate* venv (`./mpvenv`),
so it never clashes with the RAFT service's 3.13 venv. Manual equivalent:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv mpvenv
mpvenv/bin/pip install -r service/requirements-pose.txt   # mediapipe==0.10.14, opencv-python
mpvenv/bin/python service/pose_server.py                  # POST /extract on :8770
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/duck-walk.html` (standalone duck demo) or use the
**Character** tab in the main app: pick the character → **upload a walking/dancing
clip** → it animates. `assets/motion/walk-pose.json` ships a pre-captured walk so the
duck demo runs even without a fresh upload.

**Backends A — bodies + hands + face (Step 3).** The same service also extracts hands
and faces (same MediaPipe wheel, no extra install), via a `kind` param:

```bash
curl -X POST --data-binary @clip.mp4 "http://127.0.0.1:8770/extract"              # pose (default, byte-frozen)
curl -X POST --data-binary @clip.mp4 "http://127.0.0.1:8770/extract?kind=pose&fmt=b"  # + viewpoint, gap-filled
curl -X POST --data-binary @hand.mp4 "http://127.0.0.1:8770/extract?kind=hands"   # 21 landmarks x up to 2 hands
curl -X POST --data-binary @face.mp4 "http://127.0.0.1:8770/extract?kind=face"    # 468 face landmarks
```

The **default `/extract` response is unchanged** (the character rig depends on it).
`kind=hands|face` return a Contract-B *skeleton swatch* (`service/contracts.py`); they're
backend-ready but **not yet wired into the character UI** (no hands/face applicator
exists — a hands swatch would not fit the body rig). Pose `fmt=b` adds a front/side
**viewpoint** estimate and short-gap interpolation over dropped frames.

### 4. (Optional) Start the VLM Router — *motion decomposition* (Step 1)

The router looks at a clip with **Claude vision** and returns every distinct motion
in it (class + bounding box + confidence) — replacing filename/layer-name guessing
with real perception. See `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` Step 1.

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then put your key in .env (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...)
./service/run-router.sh     # first run creates ./routervenv, serves :8771
```

**Credentials.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the router
loads it automatically and uses the direct Anthropic API. If no real key is set it
falls back to **Amazon Bedrock** (`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`, model
`global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8`, region from `AWS_REGION`) via the standard AWS
credential chain. `.env` is gitignored.

Verify it end-to-end from the CLI (no server needed):

```bash
routervenv/bin/python service/decompose_cli.py assets/videos/flag.mp4
```

You get **Contract-A JSON**:

```json
{ "version": 1, "static": false, "motions": [
  { "id": "m1", "label": "waving flag", "class": "cloth",
    "bbox": [0.42, 0.10, 0.35, 0.30], "confidence": 0.94,
    "backend": "flow_raft", "applicator": "wave", "notes": "flutters left" } ] }
```

The six motion classes and their routing live in `service/contracts.py`. The app
calls it via `MotionCapture.decomposeMotion(file)` (in `js/capture.js`).

### 5. (Optional) Start the preprocess service — *mask + camera motion* (Step 2)

Turns a router bbox into a clean object **mask** (so extraction runs only inside the
moving object) and estimates **camera motion** (so it can be subtracted — fixing the
"scenery scrolls with the camera" case). Pure OpenCV, **no downloads, no API key** —
reuses `./routervenv`. See `docs/BUILD_PLAN.md` Step 2.

```bash
./service/run-preprocess.sh             # serves :8772
```

Verify from the CLI — writes a mask overlay you can eyeball (the Step-2 done-when):

```bash
routervenv/bin/python service/preprocess_cli.py assets/videos/flag.mp4 0.35,0.1,0.62,0.78 cloth
# -> /tmp/ms-flag-overlay.png : mask (red) hugs the flag, blue sky excluded; static camera
```

Returns a `region_preprocess` contract: `mask` (RLE), `camera` (`is_static`, per-frame
transforms, `residual_px`), optional `depth`. **SAM 2** (cleaner masks) and **Depth
Anything V2** are gated upgrades behind checkpoints; the download-free default is
OpenCV Farneback motion-gating. The app calls it via `MotionCapture.preprocessRegion(file, motion)`.

## How to use it (demo walkthrough)

1. Open `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Choose a scene at the top (**Poster** / **Scenery**), or click **Upload artwork**
   to load your own SVG.
3. Click an object in the artwork — it highlights and appears as a chip at the
   bottom. The **Region Inspector** opens on the right.
4. Either:
   - Click a preset in the **Motion Library** (Flag Flutter, Rising Smoke, Cloud
     Drift, …), **or**
   - Click **+ Capture motion from video**, choose a short clip (a flag, smoke,
     swaying trees, flowing water…). It extracts a new swatch into the library.
5. With the object selected, click the swatch to assign it. For cloth-like objects
   (flags, hair, water, foliage) turn on **Cloth mode** so the shape ripples in
   place rather than sliding.
6. Adjust **Speed** and **Intensity**.
7. Repeat for other objects, then press **▶ Play**.
8. **Export SVG** or **Export video** to save the result.

### Source videos

Sample source clips (flag, smoke, river, trees, birds, campfire) are **not** checked
into the repo (they're large binaries). Any short clip of a single clear motion works
— point the "Capture motion from video" picker at your own footage.

### The layer contract

An uploaded SVG becomes selectable when objects are marked
`<g class="layer" data-name="...">`. Elements with only an `id` are treated as
static backdrop. If neither is present (e.g. a flattened Illustrator export), the
app falls back to wrapping top-level drawable clusters automatically.

## Technology

- **Motion extraction:** RAFT (`torchvision` `raft_small`, C_T_V2 weights) deep
  optical flow, distilled to 8 parameters + a 12×12 trajectory grid.
- **In-browser fallback:** Lucas–Kanade flow when the service is offline.
- **Rendering:** vanilla JS, inline SVG, Canvas 2D. No framework, no bundler.
- **Tests:** `puppeteer-core` driving headless Chrome against the static server.

See `IMPLEMENTATION.md` for the full module-level spec, `informations.md` for design
rationale, and `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` for the demo narrative.

## Honest note on hardcoding

This is a **proof-of-concept built to demo well**. Some parts are genuine algorithms
and some are curated for reliability. `HARDCODING.md` documents exactly which is
which — read it before presenting this as fully automatic.
